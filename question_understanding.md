# Question and Understand the problem

This file is a record of the first step in the CRISP-DM process in which I highlight the questions and use cases that this project will address. 


## Context

During its tenure, the Roman Empire expanded much of Europe and Western Asia. This civilization brought about modern technological advancements and invested in significant infrastructure across its empire. This project seeks to examine the extent of the Empire's influence on modern day economies. The project uses archeological data about the roles of different sites in the Roman transport system and finds an association with the economies of those locations. The purpose of this analysis is to offer a partial, historical explanation for modern day economics.

## Question 1

Is there an association between attributes of Roman transportation sites and modern day economies in the region?

## Question 2

What kind of attributes can we identify from Roman transportation sites? Are there property level attributes that would have an effect? Do structural roles with the system have an effect?

## Question 3

Is location itself a significant factor? This is important because location can be influenced by many other factors. Are significant attributes only significant in certain locations?
